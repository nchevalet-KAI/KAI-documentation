### Why KAI?

|                    | KAI's Neural Semantic Graph                                                                                        | RAG                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Document Slicing   | Semantic slicing - slicing based on document creation logic. => Semantic meaning intact.                           | Basic, arbitrary chunking. => Loss of meaning.                                                                                               |
| Document Analysis  | Automatic detection of concepts and themes. Content vectorization. Generated meta. ⇒ Keeps semantic context.       | Basic vectorization. Embedding => Loss of context.                                                                                           |
| Document Indexing  | Creation of the semantic graph, following concepts and themes. => Creation of global semantic context.             | Pooling of raw vectors. => No semantic links between documents.                                                                              |
| User Search        | Analysis of search via semantic graph. Retrieval of the right documents. => Generation of contextualized response. | Retrieval of the chunks that are closest to the user's query. => Generation of answers with chunks, possibility of increased hallucinations. |
| Document Cleansing | Use of semantic graph to detect contradictory documents with respect to themes and concepts.                       | Not Applicable                                                                                                                               |
| Knowledge Mining   | Via prompt factory + Semantic graph                                                                                | Not Applicable                                                                                                                               |
