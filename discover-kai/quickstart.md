# Quickstart

### Plugged to Your Search AI, Keep Your Documents Updated

**KAI (Knowledge AI)** is a platform that enhances AI-powered search systems by automatically maintaining your document repositories. We detect when your documents are outdated, contradictory, or missing critical information—then help you fix them before users experience the problem.

### What is KAI?

KAI provides intelligent document maintenance for systems using generative AI. Whether you're using RAG, agents, copilots, or any AI search system, KAI ensures your knowledge base stays accurate, consistent, and complete.

#### The Core Problem We Solve

Your AI search system is only as good as your documents. When documents are:

* **Outdated** after product changes
* **Contradictory** across different sources
* **Missing** information users are asking about

Your AI gives confusing, incorrect, or incomplete answers. Users lose trust. Support tickets spike.

**KAI solves this by automatically detecting these issues and helping you fix them.**

### Our Products

#### 🎯 KAI Document Compagnon (Main Product)

**For:** Knowledge base managers, documentation teams, product managers, support teams—anyone who sees their AI search system struggle because documents aren't maintained.

**What it does:**

1. **Cleans up your repository** by identifying duplicate documents
2. **Detects conflicts** between documents and user queries
3. **Identifies missing topics** users are asking about
4. **Generates new documents** automatically based on your answers

**How it works:** Connects to your document repositories and your AI search system. Analyzes user queries in real-time to detect when documents need updating. Provides actionable alerts and even generates new content for you.

#### ⚙️ KAI Instance (The Technology)

**For:** CDOs, CTOs, Architects building or enhancing AI search systems.

**What it is:** A semantic indexing engine that powers KAI Document Compagnon. It creates a proprietary semantic neural network that understands relationships between information across your documents.

**How it fits:** KAI Instance serves as the intelligent retrieval component of RAG systems, providing semantic understanding instead of simple vector similarity. It's the technology that makes KAI Document Compagnon's conflict detection possible.
