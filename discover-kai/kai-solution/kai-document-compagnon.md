# KAI document compagnon

### The hidden problem you're not seeing

Your users are asking questions to your AI assistant. Some get perfect answers. Others get confused, frustrated, or misled. Why ? Because somewhere in your document repository, there are **contradictory or outdated documents** that your AI is pulling from-and you don't event know it.

Every day, these inconsistencies silently erode user trust, increase support tickets, and create confusion. The problem? You can't manually review thousands of documents every time a user asks a question.

**What if you could automatically detect which documents need updating, based on what your users are actually asking?**

### What is KAI Document Compagnon?

**KAI Document Compagnon** is a two-phase intelligent solution that first cleans up your document repository by identifying duplicates, then continuously monitors for conflicts and content gaps by analyzing real user queries from your AI search system. Instead of waiting for issues to accumulate, we detect contradictions, outdated information, and missing topics as soon as they emerge from user queries—then help you fix them quickly so they don't impact more users.

#### The Two-Phase Process

**Phase 1: Clean Up Your Repository**

1. **We connect** a KAI Instance to your document repositories
2. **We index** your entire document base with intelligent analysis
3. **We identify** all duplicate documents automatically
4. **We provide** you with a clear list of duplicates to delete

**Phase 2: Continuous Monitoring & Content Generation**

1. **We integrate** with your AI search system (RAG, agents, copilots) via API
2. **We receive** user queries in real-time from your AI system
3. **We correlate** queries with your indexed documents to detect conflicts
4. **We identify** topics users are asking about that aren't covered in your document repository
5. **We generate** questions for your document repository admin to answer
6. **We create** ready-to-use documents you can copy-paste into your document repository

Start clean, stay consistent, and grow your documentation automatically. No manual reviews. No guesswork. Just intelligent, automated document maintenance and creation.

### Why This Changes Everything

#### 🎯 Stop the Damage Before it Happens

**Phase 1 - Start Clean:** We identify and help you remove all duplicate documents first, eliminating redundancy that causes conflicting answers.

**Phase 2 - Stay Clean:** We detect inconsistencies from user queries ⇒ you Fix them proactively ⇒ Future users don't experience the problem

**Traditional approach**: Users discover inconsistencies ⇒ They report issues ⇒ You fix them ⇒ Damage already done

#### 💰 Save Time and Resources&#x20;

**Phase 1:** Stop manually searching for duplicates across thousands of documents. We identify them all automatically.

**Phase 2**: Stop spending hours manually reviewing documents for conflicts. Our system automatically identifies what needs attention, priorized by actual user impact. Focus your team's time on fixing issues, not finding them.

#### 📈 Improve Your AI's Reliability

When your AI search system pulls from contradictory documents, it gives confusing answers. By keeping your documentation consistent, you improve the quality of every AI-generated response.

#### 🔍 Gain Unprecedented Visibility

See exactly which documents are causing confusion, what questions users are asking that aren't being answered well, and where your documentation gasps are. This is intelligence you've never had before.

#### ✍️ Automatic Content Creation

Don't just identify gaps. Fill them automatically. Our AI generates complete, ready-to-use documents based on your answers to simple questions. No more staring at the blank page wondering what to write.

### How It Works

#### Phase 1: Repository Cleanup & Indexing

**Step 1: Connect KAI Instance**

We deploy a dedicated KAI instance and connect it to your document repositories ([Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/fr/software/confluence), [Notion](https://www.notion.com/fr), [Sharepoint](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration), [Google Drive](https://workspace.google.com/intl/fr/products/drive/), or any system you use).

**Step 2: Complete indexing**

Our system performs a comprehensive analysis of your entire document base:

* **Analyzes** every document in your repository
* **Indexes** content with intelligent semantic understanding
* **Structures** information for deep correlation analysis

**Step 3: Duplicate Detection**

This is where we start adding immediate value. Our AI Engine:

* **Identifies** all duplicate documents across your repository
* **Groups** similar or identical content together

**Step 4: Duplicate Report**

You receive a comprehensive report showing:

* **Which documents** are duplicates
* **Which documents** to delete

You clean up your repository first, eliminating redundancy before we event start monitoring conflicts.

#### Phase 2: Continuous Monitoring & Content Generation

**Step 1: AI system Integration**

We integrate seamlessly with your AI infrastructure via a simple **REST API**. Works with:

* **RAG systems** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
* **Conversational agents** and chatbots
* **AI copilots** and assistants
* Any AI search system that processes user queries

Your AI system sends us user queries in real-time. That's it. No complex configuration needed.

**Step 2: Real-Time Query Analysis**

As users interact with your AI system, We receive their queries and:

* **Correlate** each query with your indexed documents
* **Analyze** what information users are seeking
* **Map** queries to relevant document sections
* **Identify** queries that don't match any existing content

**Step 3: Conflict Detection**

Our AI engine continuously monitors for issues:

* **Identifies** contradictions between user queries and document content
* **Detects** outdated information that no longer matches user expectations
* **Prioritizes** issues by impact (frequency of queries, severity of contradictions)

**Step 4: Gap Detection & Topic Clustering**

This is where we help you grow your knowledge base. Our system:

* **Detects** user questions that aren't addressed by any existing documents
* **Clusters** similar questions into coherent topics
* **Identifies** recurring themes that need documentation
* **Prioritizes** topics by frequency and user impact

**Step 5: Content Generation Workflow**

For each identified topic gap, we create a streamlined workflow:

1. **Auto-Generated Questions**: We generate a series of targeted questions for your KB admin
2. **Admin Answers**: You simply answer the questions (no need to write from scratch)
3. **Document Generation**: Our AI creates a complete, well-structured document based on your answers
4. **Ready to User**: You receive a document you can copy-paste directly into your KB

**Step 6: Actionable Alerts & Recommendations**

You receive two types of actionable insights:

**Conflict Alerts:**

* **Which documents** contain contradictory or outdated information
* **Why they're problematic** (with examples of conflicting user queries)
* **Priority level** (based on user impact)
* **Suggested actions** to resolve the issue

**Content Gap Recommendations:**

* **Topics** users are asking about that aren't covered
* **Sample questions** from users for each topic
* **Priority level** (based on frequency and user impact)
* **Ready-to-user documents** after you answer our questions

### The Content Generation Workflow

#### How We Help You Create Missing Documentation

**Step 1: We Detect the Gap**

Users keep asking: "How do I configure SSO authentication?" Your KB has nothing on SSO. We detect this recurring topic and cluster all related questions together.

**Step 2: We Generate Questions for You**

Instead of asking you to write a document from scratch, we generate targeted questions:

* "What authentication methods does your system support?"
* "What are the prerequisites for SSO setup?"
* "What are the step-by-step configuration instructions?"
* "Are there any common issues users encounter?"

**Step 3: You Answer (That's It!)**

You simply answer our questions. No need to structure content, format it, or worry about what to include. Just provide the information.

**Step 4: We Generate Your Document**

Our AI takes your answers and creates a complete, well-structured document:

* Clear headings and sections
* Proper formatting
* Logical flow
* Ready to copy-paste into your KB

**Step 5: You Review and Publish**

Review the generated document, make any adjustments if needed, and publish it. Your KB now covers the topic users were asking about.

_From gap detection to published document in minutes, not hours._

### Real-World Impact

#### Phase 1: Immediate Value from Duplicate Detection

**The Problem:** Most document repositories have accumulated duplicates over time. Multiple versions of the same document exist, some outdated, some incomplete. Your AI system pulls from all of them, creating confusion.

**The Solution:** In the first phase, we identify every duplicate and tell you exactly which ones to delete. You get a clean, deduplicated repository before we even start monitoring conflicts.

**Result:** Your AI system now pulls from a clean, non-redundant document base. Fewer conflicting answers. Better user experience from day one.

#### Phase 2: Ongoing Conflict Detection & Content Generation

#### For Technical Teams

**Conflict Detection:**

* **Before:** Developers ask your AI copilot about an API endpoint. They get conflicting information from different docs. They waste hours debugging based on wrong information. The problem persists until someone reports it.
* **After:** A developer asks about API authentication and gets conflicting answers. We immediately detect the contradiction and alert you. You fix it, and the next developer gets accurate information.

**Content Generation:**

* **Before:** Developers repeatedly ask about a new integration method. Your KB doesn't cover it. Support tickets pile up.
* **After:** We detect the recurring topic, generate questions for you to answer, and create a complete integration guide you can add to your KB in minutes.

#### For Product Teams

**Conflict Detection:**

* **Before:** Users ask about a feature. Your AI assistant gives outdated information because the docs weren't updated after a product change. Users get frustrated. The problem goes unnoticed until multiple users complain.
* **After:** A user asks about Feature X and gets outdated information. We immediately detect the mismatch between queries and documentation. You're notified and update the docs. Future users get accurate information.

**Content Generation:**

* **Before:** Users keep asking about use cases that aren't documented. Your support team answers the same questions repeatedly.
* **After:** We identify the missing topics, you answer a few questions, and we generate comprehensive use case documentation automatically.

#### For Support Teams

**Conflict Detection:**

* **Before:** Support tickets spike because users are confused by contradictory information in your knowledge base. You only discover the problem after multiple complaints.
* **After:** A user gets confused by contradictory information. We detect the conflict immediately and alert you. You fix the articles before more users encounter the same issue.

**Content Generation:**

* **Before:** Users ask questions your KB doesn't answer. Support team writes custom responses every time, creating inconsistency.
* **After:** We identify the gaps, you answer our questions once, and we generate KB articles that address all related user questions consistently.
