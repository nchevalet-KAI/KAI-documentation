# API

We released a new version of our API, in July 2025, you will find all the endpoints in the coming pages below, splitted into 6 categories :&#x20;

* [orchestrator](orchestrator.md) : about the indexation of the documents
* [documents](documents.md): to get informations about the documents inside the instance, their indexation status, and basic information.
* [audit](audit.md): to retrieve all anomalies (conflicts, duplicates) found among your indexed documents
* [search](search.md): to find information inside the document and the knowledge it contains, ask a question, you will get an answer
* [conversation](conversation.md): same as search, but like a chatbot, you will be able to keep the context of the chat and previous answers
* [semantic graph](semantic-graph.md): useful to discover all the knowledge stored in the knowledge graph created from your indexed documents

> **To authenticate to our API, you will need to insert the instance\_id and the api\_key into headers. You can find these information on the admin page of your instance on the kai-studio or contact our team.**
