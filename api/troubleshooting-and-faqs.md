<summary>How do we install the tool ? </summary>

* It's a middleware, we plug to your architecture and knowledge bases and you connect to our AI through APIs.
* We have an API with the documentation of the endpoints availables, several SDKs on Github to install it easily ( Python, Typescript, PHP ) and templates examples (React, Vue)&#x20;

### Audit Module

<details>

<summary>What is detected / managed ?  </summary>

It's like a taskboard, in "detected" state, it lists all detected conflicts to check, you edit documents on your side, and the "managed" status will regenerate the indexation of the documents mentioned.&#x20;

* Which knowledge bases are compatible with your solution ? &#x20;
  * We can plug on multiple knowledge bases :  SharePoint, Drive, Confluence, Notion, â€¦&#x20;
* What is the duration of the indexation ? &#x20;
  * It depends on your documents, the types, the size, .. it can takes few minutes to few days for biggest bases.&#x20;
