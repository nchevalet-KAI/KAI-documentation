### Basic questions

<details>

<summary>How do we install the tool ?</summary>

It's a middleware, we plug to your architecture and knowledge bases and you connect to our AI through APIs.&#x20;

We have an **API** with the [documentation](api-presentation.md) of the endpoints available, several **SDKs** on [Github](sdks.md) to install it easily ( Python, Typescript, PHP, Ruby ) and templates examples (React, Vue, Streamlit).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Which knowledge bases are compatible with your solution ?</summary>

We can plug on multiple knowledge bases : SharePoint, Drive, Confluence, Notion, Service Now,â€¦

We can use the common connectors of the market, but also can connect on your in-house Knowledge base. In this case, we can check together the technical requirements.

* For the AI part, except our [homemade personalized algorithm](troubleshooting-and-faqs.md#how-do-we-manage-the-tables-charts-complex-presentations-or-data), we also use various LLM (GPT 4-o, Sonnet 3.5,..). We are agnostic and can use other LLM on-demand according to your specific context.
* We use Kubernetes to orchestrate and manage the scalable and automated deployment of our containerized solution.&#x20;
* We can provide more explanation on demand.

### Audit Module

<details>

<summary>What is detected / managed ?</summary>

It's like a taskboard, in "detected" state, it lists all detected conflicts to check, you edit documents on your side, and the "managed" status will regenerate the indexation of the documents mentioned.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is missing subjects ?</summary>

We collect the queries from the search and chatbot modules, made by your users, and aggregate all the missing answers of our system due to a lack of information in your knowledge base.&#x20;

Yes, with the API endpoint : /documents-to-manage,  you will be able to get all the documents with a issue about a conflict or a duplication. Then, use the&#x20;

<summary>If I have many similar but potentially wrong informations in my knowledge base, what kind of answer we will get?</summary>

If the multidocument parameter is on true, the /query endpoint will retrieve all documents mentioning the information, without selecting one answer. It's up to you, to choose the correct one. It's also why, we advise to do an Audit before.&#x20;

If the multidocument parameter is on false, we will provide the most possible correct answer according to our algorithm, but it's possible to retrieve a bad/outdated answer.
